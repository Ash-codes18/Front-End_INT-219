## Timeout events


- Create 2 buttons inside a box, when clicked on the first button it should show you the current time and when clicked on the second button it should stop the first button from showing the time.

- Create a button that when clicked on it should show you the current time every 3 seconds.

- Create a short code on the usage of `setTimeout` and `clearTimeout` in JavaScript.
